Hello, hello hello? Hi, welcome to your first day at Citadel Border Security! Iâ€™m here to walk you through the process. It's pretty simple, really.

See that door on the left, behind the window? That's the entrance to the city. People will be coming in, and your job is to check them out, assess their documents, and decide if they're allowed in.

Each person must present a valid entry card, as well as a health assessment from a certified medical center. Also, be sure to keep an eye out for anything unusual. Maybe weapons, unusual behavior, or anything else that doesn't sit right with you.

Okay, I'll leave you to it. Just remember... you're the last line of defense. Take it seriously. Good luck!

Officials assure us these steps are necessary to keep Citadel safe from external threats. While some may find these measures strict, they're essential for maintaining peace and security.

Citadel Border Security remains committed to your protection. Stay alert, report any suspicious activity, and trust in the safety we provide.
